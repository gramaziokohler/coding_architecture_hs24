# Coding Architecture I: HS24

Materials for the "Coding Architecture I", Autumn Semester 2024.

> Coding Architecture I-II<br>
> is a **programming class for architects**<br>
> with particular focus on **demystifying technology**
> -both software and hardware-<br>
> **and exploring the programmability of our world**<br>
> through powerful methods of digital, computational, and algorithmic design.

## Getting started

See [here](/getting-started/README.md) for details about software requirements and installation of the tools.

## Course information

The central platform for all course content is [Moodle](https://moodle-app2.let.ethz.ch/course/view.php?id=22789).

## Lectures

* [Week 01](/lectures/week-01/README.md) | [Ungraded assignment](assignments/A00-ungraded-assignment/README.md)

## Roadmap

See [here](roadmap/README.md) for the **Roadmap: becoming a computational designer**,
that provides guidance during the learning process and helps you understand how much
you've progressed and what are the skills and concepts that you should master in order
to move forward.

## Teaching Material

We have compiled a list of essential links and resources to support your learning throughout the semester. These materials cover foundational topics in programming, computational geometry, visual programming, Rhino, and Grasshopper. You will also find API references that include the methods, classes, and functions needed for your assignments and projects. Additionally, we've included a selection of books and other resources to help you deepen your understanding of the course topics. These resources are intended to provide you with the necessary tools and information as you progress through the course.
