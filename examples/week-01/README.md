# Coding Architecture I: Week 01

The first week covers a lot of the practicalities of the course followed by an introduction
to python programming using Rhino/Grasshopper.

The following files might guide you in understanding the concepts presented during the lecture.

- [Anatomy of Code](00_anatomy_of_code_hs24.gh)
- [Overview of Arithmetic Operators](01_arithmetic_operations_hs24.gh)
- [Overview of Other Operators](02_operators_hs24.gh)

There is as well the ungraded assignment, to practice arithmetic operations in Python within the context of Grasshopper:

Additionally, you might want to take a look at the [roadmap: becoming a computational designer](../../roadmap/README.md).
