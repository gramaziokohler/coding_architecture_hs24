## Overview

This week we’re programming the final components of our building grid. We’ll finish our structure by adding facades, completing the primary architectural elements. Using the VolMesh data structure, we’ll find methods to create these elements dynamically.

We'll also revisit attractor points as a way to introduce a bit of creativity, allowing for design adjustments across facade elements based on the proximity to these points.

>**Learning Goals:** Further understand and apply classes to add a facade to our building.

## Attractor Exercise

The goal of this exercise is understand attractor points in order to apply them to the building/facade design later on:

## GPT-Workshop Part 2

This week also includes Part 2 of the GPT Workshop, where we aim to leverage the full capabilities of GPT for debugging and solving complex exercises in a streamlined way. The session will cover: Using GPT to identify and correct code errors quickly.
How to structure larger problem-solving tasks with GPT to save time and achieve solutions with fewer steps.

## Tutorial Series

We’ll complete our building element classes by creating **facades** within the building grid, using the VolMesh data structure. Additionally, we will do some design experimantation, implement **attractor points** to add variability to the facade expression and tweak the regular structure of the grid by introducing height variance.
