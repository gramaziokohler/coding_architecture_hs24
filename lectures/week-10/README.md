## Overview

During the semester, we have explored different aspects of the Python language, and learned how to use it to create classes that represent elements of a building structure based on a regular grid. Now it is time to integrate this knowledge into a more cohesive & complete exercise: the final project.

>**Learning Goals of the Final Project:** Integrate all knowledge gained during the assignments into a more complete building structure.
