## Overview

During the semester, we have explored different aspects of the Python language, and learned how to use it to create classes that represent elements of a building structure based on a regular grid. Now it is time to integrate this knowledge into a more cohesive & complete exercise: the final project.

>**Learning Goals of the Final Project:** Integrate all knowledge gained during the assignments into a more complete building structure.

## A03 Review

We’ll begin with a walkthrough of Assignment 03. This review will cover:

* A brief overview of the main task, which was previously demonstrated in class.
* Challenge 01: Assigning categories to each slab. Each slab can be categorized as "roof", "floor_slab", or "bottom_slab".
* Challenge 02: Visualizing all the slabs in our building grid in a stacked or "palletized" version.

### Design Project

In this final assignment, you will integrate all the concepts learned throughout the course into a comprehensive building structure. Using Python programming, you will create a building that incorporates architectural components such as slabs, columns, and facade walls, sculpted by a filter class.

Your building will be placed in a real location in the city of Zurich. You can choose one of the following five plot locations for your design project: **Altstetten**, **Hardturm**, **Letzi**, **Heinrich-Areal**, or **Escher Wyss**. Each location has unique characteristics and potential constraints, so consider factors like plot size, shape, and local context when making your choice.
